    <h3> What’s best? Heaps of Practice Questions or Logic?​ </h3>
    <%= simple_format(" 
    One of the things many people ask is ‘Where can I get my hands on more practice questions?’ 
     
    Having tutored many students for the selective schools test and entrance exam, I’m a big believer of doing practice questions, however, that being said, I’m a big believer in doing practice questions properly.  This means, not doing hundreds and hundreds of practice questions without thought but rather doing a few practice tests (the ones freely available) and then understanding the logic or reasoning behind each question.  This last part, takes time. 
     
    I know there are a lot of practice questions around, online and in print for the selective schools test and entrance exam.  However, I’m not quite sold on the notion that the more practice questions you churn through, the more prepared you are for the exam.  This is my reason:  A person doing 100s of practice question is unlikely to dedicate their time to understanding each part of their question in depth, whereas the person who does less has a greater depth of understanding.  Without this understanding, it is difficult to know what to apply in the exam if you encounter a ‘new’ question.  However, with understanding, you can apply it in many different scenarios.  So in summary - Quality over Quantity any day!
     
    I’ve found that my successful students were the ones who understood the logic and reasoning behind each question of the selective schools test and entrance exam.  They took time to understand why something works the way it does and they’ve kept this knowledge and applied it in the exam.  I have brought to light this knowledge of logic and reasoning in my book: General Ability to Reach for Exam Success (available to download at Selectivetest.net)  
     
    How to complete practice questions properly in the selective schools test and entrance exam?

    My method is simple.  I spend as long as it takes to tick off the following list for each question:
    (1) Find the right solution and understand why it is the correct solution
    (2) Understand why the other solutions are incorrect
    (3) Why people would choose the incorrect solution
    (4) What the missing information is that would bring me to the correct solution
    (5) What knowledge do I need in the exam to help me find the solution if this type of question arose
    (6) What is the question writer trying to test you on?
     
    Yes, the list is long but it will help your child understand each question in more detail.  Unsurprisingly, this is the same method I’ve used in the past.  On average, I would say that for each question, I would think about each question for around 15-30 minutes.  When you think about a 60 questions test paper, this is a very long time!
     
    Try it – the results will be surprising.

    <h3> Helping your child with un-coding the code in General Ability!</h3>
    ​
    <%= simple_format("
      By Vi Nguyen, author of General Ability to reach for Exam Success (Uploaded 3 December 2012)
      ​
      One of my favourite areas in the selective schools test and entrance exam is general ability. It’s like putting together a puzzle. You pick up each piece, assemble it … but wait there’s still a piece missing. This is the piece that you create but it has to be the right shape in order to fit but how do you know if it will? Try it before the exam!
      ​
      I’m going to show you how you can help your darling daughter or son to create the right shape to complete your puzzle for the ‘un-coding the code’ type questions that commonly appear in the exam.
      ​
      Let’s take an adaptation of the reasoning behind question 17 of Sample Test 1 from the NSW Department of Education – you can find it here: http://www.schools.nsw.edu.au/media/downloads/schoolsweb/learning/k_6assessments/ss/gatest1.pdf
      ​
      If the word UMPIRE is coded 380124
      ​
      Then the word IMPLICIT would be coded
      ​
      (a)18100705
      ​
      (b)18071417
      ​
      (c)18011219
      ​
      (d)18091715
      ​
      How do I go through this question with my child? The key here is comparing the two words and discovering how the code links them together. First, I would look at both words and establish what’s similar and what’s different. The letters “M”, “P” and “I” are present in both words. Let’s now see how the code relates to the two words. First, we need to test our ‘guesses’. When we look at the word UMPIRE and the number code in order, it looks like “M” could be 8 and “I” could be 1. When I look at the choices, it’s clear that “I” = 1 as all the choices start with 1 and “M” = 8 as in all the choices, the second number is 8. Jackpot! I’ve figured out how my code works, it’s: U = 3, M = 8, P = 0, I = 1, R = 2, E = 4
      ﻿
      ​
      All we have to do now is find the choice which follows this pattern (that is, find the shape that fits in the puzzle). In this case, it’s (d) 18091715!
      ​
      This sounds easy, but in practice there are a lot of things to consider. For example, the letters “L”, “C” and “T” are in “IMPLICIT” but not in “UMPIRE” – what numbers do they represent? Given that they are all different letters, their numbers must be unique and this is the key to the last part of this answer.
      ​
      Walk your child through each step slowly asking them questions why a certain choice may or may not work. This will allow them to practice their reasoning before the exam as well as encouraging them to think about alternative solutions - if Google (the internet monolith) uses this in their hiring practices, it must be a good skill to develop!
